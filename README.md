This repository hosts the source code and web application for the Oonee Network Development Tool, developed in Spring 2023. The tool was developed by the Oonee Urban Planning Capstone group at NYU Wagner.

The network development framework tool uses transit, bicycle theft, employment, and bicycle infrastructure data to help Oonee identify areas for expansion and planning in the New York City metropolitan area. The tool creates a score that weighs these criteria, revealing neighborhoods where secure bicycle parking could thrive. By using this tool, Oonee can strengthen public-private partnerships and add value to the station planning process with collaborators.
